## Analog-to-Digital Converter - Electronics I

Used LM741CN op-amps as comparators to convert an analog voltage signal ranging from 0 to 7 volts into an equivalent digital (discrete) signal output through LEDs. Designed and verified circuit in LTSpice, then built physical circuit. Added additional “party mode” strobe light effect by swapping DC input voltage with function generator using triangle wave

## Minesweeper - Sophomore Design

Programmed Pololu 3pi Robot to traverse 36x48” black-lined grid and find user defined number of 1x1” white “mines”. Directly programmed hardware. Defined motors as output, light sensors as input, buttons as input, LCD display as output, and piezo (speaker) as output. Created functions to self-correct movement to stay on grid by using current state of light sensors and adjusting left/right motor power using PWM; 360-spin when mine found, play music when mine found, separately handle three/four-way intersections and corners. Worked with teammate. Used AVR-GCC to compile C code.

## FPGA Calculator - Sophomore Design

Used logic gates, adders, and multiplexers to design and implement a calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide using toggle switches on the BASYS 3 Artix-7 and output results on the seven�segment display. Programmed in Verilog. Implemented and synthesized in Vivado.## Welcome to GitHub Pages
